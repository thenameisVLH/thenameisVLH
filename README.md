Hey there everyone!

I am VLHanchate, or Venkatasai Laksh Hanchate! I enjoy doing Math, Programming, solving Rubik's Cube, Typing, Card Tricks, Sports, and Music! I even run a
     
YT channel where I post videos pretty often. You might want to check them out so that you can subscribe and like my videos because who knows what could
     
happen if you don't. Bad Luck❓❔ My favorite programming languages are Python, Javascript, and HTML. I know a few others too.

Here are links to my corners of the universe!
